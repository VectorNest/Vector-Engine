# Become a Provider in this Product Category

If you want to start providing services in this Product Category follow the steps below.

1. [Register in the Protocol](#1-register-in-the-protocol),
2. [Register in this Product Category](#2-register-in-this-product-category),
3. [Register Offers](#3-register-offers),
4. [Fork and Implement This Repository](#4-fork-and-implement-this-repository),
5. [Run the Provider Daemon](#5-run-the-provider-daemon).

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Prerequisites

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (min version 22.12.0) environment, Forest Protocols [CLI](https://github.com/Forest-Protocols/forest-cli) tool and a functional PostgreSQL (min version 16) database for the daemon. To install that environment, you can check the links below;

- Node.js [official](https://nodejs.org/en/download) downloads page
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - Node Version Manager, helps to manage multiple Node versions at the same time.
- PostgreSQL [official](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) downloads page (if you want to run Postgres natively)
- Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) for PostgreSQL (if you want to run dockerized Postgres)

#### 1. Register in the Protocol

> You can skip this part if you are already registered in the Protocol as a Provider.

1. Create a JSON detail file in the following schema and save it somewhere:

```json
{
  "name": "<Name, will be visible to users>",
  "description": "<[Optional] Description>",
  "homepage": "<[Optional] Homepage address>"
}
```

2. Create a set of pub / priv keys using an EVM-compatible wallet.
3. Take that account's private key and save it to a file.
4. Put the JSON file and that private key file into the same folder.
5. Open up a terminal in that folder.
   > If you are planning to use different accounts for billing and operating, you need to pass additional flags: `--billing <address>` and `--operator <address>`. This separation increases security of your configuration. Setting a billing address allows for having a separate address / identity for claiming your earnings and rewards while setting an operator allows you to delegate the operational work of running a daemon and servicing user requests to a third-party or a hotkey. If you don't need that, just skip those flags and the logic of the Protocol will use your main address as your billing and operator address.
6. Run the following command to register in the Protocol to be allowed to interact with Protocol's resources:
   ```sh
    forest register provider \
        --details <JSON file name> \
        --account <private key file>
   ```
   TESTNET NOTE: if you need testnet tokens reach out to the Forest Protocols team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2MsTWq2tc7).
7. Save your detail file somewhere. Later you'll place this file into `data/details` folder.

#### 2. Register in this Product Category

You can take part in many Product Categories. In order to join this one run the following command:

```shell
forest provider register-in \
  --account <private key file path OR private key itself of the Provider account> \
  --product-category 0x7069D0F75198d99df4F640C6fFC1f33FBA3e6EF0 \
  --collateral 15
```

#### 3. Register Offers

Now that you are registered in the Protocol and this Product Category, the next step is to register your Offers.

First, create files that contain details for each Offer you plan to register. You have two options for these detail files:

- Create a plain text or Markdown file with human-readable Offer details. This approach does not allow parameterization of Offers. Also these details won't be visible in the CLI. However this approach is often good enough for a number of use cases like API access.
- Create a JSON file following the schema below. This approach makes Offer details visible and filterable in the CLI and the Marketplace while also allowing parameterization of resource creation.

##### 3.1 Creating the Offer details file

**Plain text example**

```
Minimum of 2 requests per minute.
At least 200 API calls per subscription per month.
```

**JSON schemed example**

Create a JSON file following the type definitions below:

> These are pseudo-type definitions to illustrate the JSON schema.

```typescript
type Numeric_Offer_Parameter = {
  value: number;
  unit: string;
};

type Single_Offer_Parameter = string | boolean | Numeric_Offer_Parameter;

type Multiple_Offer_Parameter = Single_Offer_Parameter[];

type Offer_Parameter = Single_Offer_Parameter | Multiple_Offer_Parameter;

type JSON_Offer_Details = {
  name: string; // Descriptive name
  deploymentParams?: any; // Deployment parameters for resource creation in the Provider daemon.

  // Visible parameters to users
  params: {
    [visible_parameter_name: string]: Offer_Parameter;
  };
};
```

An example JSON file based on these type definitions:

```json
{
  "name": "SQLite Cheap Small Disk",
  "deploymentParams": {
    "maxRAM": "512",
    "diskSize": "1024"
  },
  "params": {
    "RAM": {
      "value": 512,
      "unit": "MB"
    },
    "Disk Size": {
      "value": 1,
      "unit": "GB"
    },
    "Disk Type": "SSD",
    "Features": ["Query over Pipe", "Super cheap"]
  }
}
```

##### 3.2 Saving the file

After creating the Offer details file, save it in an accessible location.

##### 3.3 Registering the Offer on-chain

Now register your Offer using the following command:

```shell
forest provider register-offer \
    --account <private key file path OR private key itself of the PROV account> \
    --product-category 0x7069D0F75198d99df4F640C6fFC1f33FBA3e6EF0 \
    --details <path of the details file> \
    --fee 1 \
    --stock 100
```

- `--fee`: The per-second price of the Offer in USDC. 1 unit of fee = 2.60 USDC per month.
- `--stock`: The maximum number of Agreements that can exist simultaneously for this Offer.

#### 4. Fork and Implement This Repository

Fork this repository, then clone it locally.

Open the `src/product-category/provider.ts` file and implement all of the following methods;

Once implementation is complete, place your Provider and Offer detail files into the `data/details` folder.

> You can create subdirectories to better organize detail files.

Now, create a `.env` file based on the example (`.env.example`) and configure the necessary variables:

| Name           | Possible Values                                              | Default     | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`     | `dev`, `production`                                          | `dev`       | The environment mode.                                 |
| `RPC_URL`      | An RPC host without the protocol part (`http://` or `ws://`) | `undefined` | The RPC host used to communicate with the blockchain. |
| `CHAIN`        | `anvil`, `optimism`, `optimism-sepolia`                      | `anvil`     | Specifies the blockchain to use.                      |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string                                 | `undefined` | The database connection string for the daemon.        |

Then rename `data/providers.example.jsonc` to `data/providers.json`, clear the comments inside of it and fill the `main` tag with your private keys.

As the last step, don't forget to put detail files of the Provider, Product Category and Offers into `data/details` folder.

#### 5. Run the Provider Daemon

You can run the daemon process with or without a container.

##### 5.1 Without a Container

> Ensure you have a running PostgreSQL database before proceeding.

Run the following commands in the daemon directory:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
npm run db:migrate
npm run start
```

##### 5.2 With a Container

If you prefer to use containers, build the container image and run it with Docker Compose. First, update the `DATABASE_URL` host to point to the database container:

```dotenv
...
# Update the host to "db"
# Database credentials are defined in "docker-compose.yaml";
# update the compose file if you change them.
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres

# If using a local Foundry blockchain, update the RPC_HOST variable.
# RPC_HOST=172.17.0.1:8545
...
```

Now run the compose file:

```shell
docker compose up # Add "-d" to run in detached mode
```

That's all folks!
